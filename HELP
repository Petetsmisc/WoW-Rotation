Ok, so how do I use the download zip file that is listed?
Where do I create the "abilities" folder?
What formate "icon pics" should be in, would the windows screen snap work (down to just the icon itself)
Where is the executable to run this?

Can a comprehansive document as to how to run/ use this be provided.

I have seen simlure programes that use icon recognition but what they do is use the icons that TellMeWhen provides (one at a time) 
They just drag the icon to the program.

But anyway, is this a standalone programe that will run with the addition of the "abilities" folder with coreectly named 
files (icons)?

Thanls for your help
